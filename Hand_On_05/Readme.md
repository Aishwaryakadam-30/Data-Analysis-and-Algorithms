# Min-Heap Implementation

This project provides an implementation of a **Min-Heap** in Python.

The key features of this implementation include:
- A **generic heap structure** that supports multiple data types such as integers, floats, and custom objects.
- Maintenance of the **min-heap property**, ensuring the smallest element remains at the root.
- Core heap functionalities:
  - **Insertion** of new elements while preserving the heap order.
  - **Removal of the root element**, followed by heap property restoration.
  - **Construction of a min-heap** from an unordered list.
  - **Accessing the root** element without modifying the heap structure.
