# Data Structures & Quicksort-Based Order Statistic Finder

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures—Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List—using fixed-size arrays, along with an algorithm to determine the `i`-th order statistic through **Quicksort**. These implementations focus on integer storage and use C-style arrays for efficient memory management.

### Repository Contents

1. **Finding the `i`-th Order Statistic Using Quicksort**
    - **Description**: Utilizes the Quicksort algorithm to efficiently determine the `i`-th smallest element in an unsorted array.
    - **Average Time Complexity**: O(n log n)

2. **Core Data Structures: Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List**
    - **Description**: Implements fundamental data structures with key operations, simulating their functionality through fixed-sized arrays. Each structure supports standard operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching.

## Implemented Data Structures

### Stack
- **Operations Available**:
  - `push()`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
  - `pop()`: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
  - `peek()`: Retrieves the top element without modifying the stack.
  - `isEmpty()`: Checks if the stack is empty.
  - `size()`: Returns the current number of elements in the stack.

### Queue
- **Operations Available**:
  - `enqueue()`: Adds an element to the back of the queue.
  - `dequeue()`: Removes an element from the front of the queue.
  - `isEmpty()`: Checks whether the queue is empty.
  - `size()`: Returns the total number of elements in the queue.
  
### Singly Linked List
- **Operations Available**:
  - `insertAtBeginning()`: Inserts an element at the start of the list.
  - `insertAtEnd()`: Appends an element to the end of the list.
  - `deleteNode()`: Removes a node with a specified value.
  - `search()`: Finds and retrieves an element within the list.
  - `display()`: Outputs all elements in the linked list.
