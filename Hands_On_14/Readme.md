## 🚀 Algorithms Implemented

### 🔍 Depth-First Search (DFS)
A recursive traversal technique that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

- Input: Directed graph via adjacency matrix
- Output: DFS traversal order
- Usage: `run_dfs()`

---

### 📊 Topological Sort (DFS-based)
Sorts the vertices of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in a linear order such that for every directed edge `u → v`, `u` comes before `v`.

- Input: DAG in adjacency matrix form
- Output: Topologically sorted order of nodes
- Usage: `run_topological_sort()`

---

### 🌲 Kruskal's Algorithm
Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, weighted, undirected graph using the union-find technique.

- Input: Weighted undirected graph via adjacency matrix
- Output: Set of MST edges and their total cost
- Usage: `run_kruskal()`
