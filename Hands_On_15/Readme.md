1. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
   - Handles graphs with negative weight edges.
   - Detects negative-weight cycles.

2. **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**
   - Efficient for graphs with non-negative edge weights.
   - Computes shortest paths from a single source to all nodes.

3. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**
   - Computes all-pairs shortest paths.
   - Demonstrated using both iterative and recursive styles.
