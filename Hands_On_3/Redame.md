## Code

```
function x = f(n)
   x = 1;
   for i = 1:n
       for j = 1:n
           x = x + 1;
```

## Results

### Big-O Notation (O)
The function `f(n)` is \( O(n^2) \) because the runtime grows quadratically with \( n \).

### Big-Omega Notation (Œ©)
The function `f(n)` is \( Œ©(n^2) \) because the runtime has a lower bound that grows quadratically with \( n \).

### Big-Theta Notation (Œò)
The function `f(n)` is \( Œò(n^2) \) because the runtime grows quadratically with \( n \), and both the upper and lower bounds are \( n^2 \).

This value of ùëõ is approximately where the function starts behaving quadratically.

## Modified Code

```
x = f(n)
   x = 1;
   y = 1;
   for i = 1:n
        for j = 1:n
             x = x + 1;
             y = i + j;
```

### Time Complexity:
Even though there's an additional operation `y = i + j`, this does not affect the number of iterations of the nested loops.

Each loop still iterates `n √ó n` times, and the additional operation inside each iteration does not increase the overall time complexity. Hence, the time complexity of the modified function remains `O(n¬≤)`. 
However, the constant factor involved in the execution time might be slightly higher due to the extra computation of y.

## Effect on #1 results

In the original function analysis `(#1)`, the runtime was determined to be `O(n¬≤)` based on the number of iterations in the nested loops.

The additional operation in the modified function does not change this result:
- The time complexity remains O(n¬≤) since the number of iterations remains the same.
- However, the extra computation inside the loop means that the actual runtime will increase slightly, although this is a constant factor and does not affect the asymptotic complexity.
